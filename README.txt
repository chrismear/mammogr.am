mammogr.am, because:

"I would like one called mammagr.am that tells me where all the booby photos are being taken. There I said it."

To run this program (but really, why would you want to?):

1. Make your own copy of local_settings.yml.example; save it as local_settings.yml. (You will need an Instagram API registration).
2. Make sure your bundle is complete: bundle install.
3. Rack it up: bundle exec rackup.

I am rather ashamed of this program, but the philosophy of free software together with the requirements of copyright law mean I have to put my name to it.
